# The Monty Hall Problem
A simple python script demonstrating the Monty Hall Problem.

The player chooses one door out of three.
The gamehost opens up one of the other doors, showing the player it's empty.
The player will then need to decide whether to stick with the original door, or to pick the one remaining door.

By sticking to their original choice, the chance of winning is 33%
By changing doors, the chance of winning is 66%
